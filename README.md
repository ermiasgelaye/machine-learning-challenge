# Machine Learning- Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data,a machine learning models were created to classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

    * [Random_Forest](#Random_forest)
    * [Support Vector Machine(SVM)](#Support-Vector-Machine)
    * [K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm](#K-Nearest-Neighbors-Algorithm) 
    * [Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning](#Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning)

### Preprocess the Data
* Preprocessing was conducted to the dataset prior to fitting the models.
* Feature selection and remove unnecessary features was conducted fro all models.
* I used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* I Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* I used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* I tuned and compare the reported classifiers.

### Reporting
In this project I used five machine learning models in order to tarin, test and classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset. In the reporting section summary about the findings, assumptions and comparison of models is executed.
